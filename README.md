Hey guys, I wanted to show you here how a simulation written in python could look like.

I implemented a satellite with a single reaction wheel and simulated the change in attitude and angular velocity.

If you want to try it out, open `demo.py` and execute it.

The actual simulation methods are implented in `/simulation/satellite/satellite_state.py`
